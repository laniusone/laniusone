#+title: Lanius One

Hi there, my name is Lanius (well, not actually) and I do some stuff on the internet. I do some coding as a hobby, and also way more coding as a job.

I use Linux, I like Linux, I talk about Linux, but also about programming and software in general.

I have some public repos here, but except for [[https://github.com/voidekh/kyotonight.vim][kyotonight.vim]] and [[https://github.com/voidekh/SigmaVimRc][SigmaVimRc]], they are outdated or were created only to contribute to something.
